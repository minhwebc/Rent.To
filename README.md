## The Technology
### Firebase
We used Firebase, Google's mobile and web application development platform, for their authentication service, storage service, and real-time database. Firebase is easy to use, and helps to manage users and synchronize data across clients. 

### Android
We decided to build our application using Java and the Android SDK. We chose this because it offers a robust programming experience and helped us to get our app running quickly.
